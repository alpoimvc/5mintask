# 5mins React Challenge
The goal of the exercise is to build a simple React SPA using themoviedb.org API
Problem:
Build a UI that lets a user search for a movie and display the results in a list. When clicking on a
list item, a page showing some details about the movie should be displayed.

Possible improvements (not implemented due to lack of time):
 - Organize styles (either leveraging MUI's theme, or using classes)
 - Better responsiveness
 - More loading indicators

How to run locally:

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
